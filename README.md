# Readme_Gen

Homework 9 UW Bootcamp ! 

## Table of Contents

## Developer Comment

Welcome to my Readme Genarator, I was given the task to create an application which generates a readme genator. I hope you take the time to read through the instructions and let me know if there's anything wrong with this application. 

It took me longer than expected, but I got it all working at the end. Guess it doesn't hur to keep on trying and trying. 

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
